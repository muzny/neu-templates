Please list internal and external grants separately. 
It is recommended that you also list proposals that were not funded. 
If you list unsuccessful applications, those should be clearly differentiated from successful ones. 
Pending proposals should be listed with the amount requested and the notification date. 
For each successful grant, please identify your status -- PI, co-PI, other, as well as the roles of other participants on the grantâ€”and indicate the percentage of the grant attributed to your effort (as reported on the grant Proposal Processing Form). 
If a grant supports programmatic or group work, you should clarify your precise role in the work. 
You should indicate the amount received (total direct costs and annual budget) and the coverage period of successful grants, as well as the funding agency and the title of the proposal.
